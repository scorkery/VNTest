nar|This is a demonstration of the capabilities of my iOs Visual Novel engine.
nar|This software is unfinished but the following functions work:
nar|Dialog, Character entrances/exits, background change, set variable, test variable, add/subtract (for number variables), test variable (for condition, followed by instruction to execute if condition is true), jump (exits current script file and jumps to another)
nar|At present, the program reads and executes one instruction from a given script file every time the screen is tapped/clicked, including logic instructions that do not draw anything to the screen.  These instructions will log a message to the console to clarify what is happening.
nar|In future versions background logic instructions (and some drawing instructions) will execute and then execute additional instructions automatically until the next piece of dialog occurs.  This function is not yet implemented.
nar|Demo will now begin.
nar|Change screen background.
background|street.png|fade
nar|Enter character.
enter|Ui|main.png|{200,150}|{94.8,400.0}|fade
Ui|Hello, I am a blatantly plagiarized character and this is some dialog.
Ui|I will leave now.
exit|Ui|fade
nar|Testing variables.
setVar|Ui|powerLevel|9000
testVar|Ui|powerLevel|9001|jump|Demo1
nar|If you are reading this text we are still in the original Demo script.
add|Ui|powerLevel|1
testVar|Ui|powerLevel|9001|jump|Demo1
nar|If you are still reading this then the thing did not work correctly.
